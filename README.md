This project uses an API to display facts about cats.

## About

Upon loading the page the tab titles are fetched from the cat facts API.
Whatever tab is clicked on a fetch request is made to retrive the cat facts.
The selected tab will be displayed until another tab is clicked.

## Technical Details

### Technology Used

Javascript, HTML and CSS

### Data Structures

With HTML I created a box with tabs

With Javascript i used the fetch method to access the cat facts.
I created a function to add the facts and an image on every tab clicked.
I added an event listener so the selected tab will display until another tab is clicked.

With CSS i styled the page
